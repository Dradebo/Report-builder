Bloody hell mehn. It could not possibly be this simple, could it?

I'd like to imagine so. What does that mean?

Hope? Faith? Belief?

Flattery of the highest order...

When one is aped by one who believes they are above it all.

Do you take the hand of the deceiver...

Because of the bliss of being a receiver...

Something you've never known,

Not knowing claws at your soul

The toll very real, the source 

No thicker than smoke or touchable 

As an image in a mirror.

Do you not know that that ignorance is bliss

And finding out is only the result of 

fucking around.

The want to get more only leads to more giving.

The need to expand means your lot has to be filled.

That will not happen with sacrifice of blood

Silence of a lamb

And submission to the one.

Who has no need and no ask.
